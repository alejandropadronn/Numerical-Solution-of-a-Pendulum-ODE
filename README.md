# Numerical-Solution-of-a-Pendulum-ODE
Matlab code that uses the well established Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) numerical method for solving both a linear and non-linear ordinary differential equation of a pendulum.
This code was created as a final project assignment for a numerical methods class

***This code only applies for an initial-value problem (IVP)***
The boundary conditions are:
- initial angle = pi/2 radians
- intitial angular velocity = 0 radians/seconds

This code implements varying step-sizes (h) and graphs the results obtained from the different step-sizes. 
All implementations of the code are constructed WITHOUT using any built-in matlab functions that would enable shortcuts as that was a restriction placed on the class.
